# Enhancement 5: GraphQL Integration

## Description
Add support for defining and serving GraphQL APIs alongside REST endpoints.

## Impact
- Enable GraphQL API creation
- Support for mixed REST/GraphQL APIs
- Schema generation from types
- GraphQL playground integration

## Implementation
1. Add GraphQL dependencies
2. Create GraphQL schema builder
3. Support GraphQL endpoint configuration:
```javascript
{
  graphql: {
    schema: {
      types: {
        User: `
          type User {
            id: ID!
            name: String!
            posts: [Post!]!
          }
        `
      },
      queries: {
        user: {
          type: "User",
          args: { id: "ID!" },
          resolve: getUserResolver
        }
      }
    },
    playground: true
  },
  endpoints: {
    // Regular REST endpoints here
  }
}
```

4. Add GraphQL middleware and resolvers
5. Integrate GraphQL Playground
6. Add documentation and examples
7. Support for GraphQL subscriptions

## Effort Estimation
XLarge - 7-8 days

## Risk Level
High - Complex integration with significant architectural changes
